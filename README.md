## Motivation

I wanted to push my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to its limit, while making something that I wanted to use.  As someone who highly values organization and planning, making an all-in-one calendar app sounded like a great way of showcasing my skills.  And what really drew me was the chance to use the OpenWeather API, since most calendar apps do not have a weekly forecast even though weather can play a large role in how we plan our week.

## Technologies

Built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.  The application applies **AJAX** to populate the calendar with real-time data using **OpenWeather** and **Calendarific** APIs, uses **GreenSock** for transitions.

## Features
